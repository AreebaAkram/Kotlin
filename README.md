# Andriod Projects built using Kotlin
This repository contains all the projects tat i have built using Kotlin. 
## 1st : Song App
This is a kotlin based demonstration of MVVM architecture and JetPack Components. This projects helps in understanding the design pattern of MVVM architecture -
how it separates business logics from data presentation logic. This projects allows to perform CRUD operations with each song containing Song name, Artist name and thumbnail image.

### How it functions:
<li> Allows user to add song details </li>
<li> Edit song details </li>
<li> Delete song item </li>

### Concepts used:
<li> Recycler view & Linear Layout </li>
<li> DOM & Room Databases </li>
<li> Live Data </li>
<li> View Binding </li>
